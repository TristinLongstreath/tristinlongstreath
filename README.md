### Hi there 

My name is Tristin and I am a Computer Information Systems student who loves fun projects and creating something impactful. I am interested in the world of technology, and the ever evolving cycle of this new era. I want to use technology to improve people's everday life, and creat a more substainable, accessible, and inclusive world.
